THREE PAGE HTML HOMEWORK
WORK DONE BY GEORGE AGUILAR

THE GOAL OF THIS HOMEWORK WAS TO UTILIZE BOOTSTRAP AND TO MINIMIZE LOCAL CSS AND MEDIA QUERIES

I FEEL LIKE I OVERCAME A LOT OF OBSTACLES AND MADE SOME GOOD BREAKTHROUGHS.

CHANGES I MADE TO INDEX.HTML 
------------------------------------------
THE FIRST THING I DID WAS APPLY A LINK TO THE BOOTSTRAP WHERE I CAN GRAB ALL MY STYLES FROM

I CHOSE A NAV BAR THAT LOOKED GOOD FROM BOOTSTRAP. BUT IT DIDNT FLOAT MY OPTIONS TO THE RIGHT LIKE IN THE EXAMPLE PHOTOS. SO I MADE A SECOND FLOAT-RIGHT STYLE NAVBAR AND PUT MY OPTIONS IN THERE SO THAT IT WOULD LOOK GOOD. I ALSO USED A BUTTON TO MAKE THE NAV DROPDOWN MENU ICON.

TO OBTAIN SIMILAR UNDERLINE LINEBREAKS AS IN THE EXAMPLE PHOTO, I USED <HR> INSTEAD OF <BR> SO THAT I COULD GET A LINE BREAK WITH AN UNDERLINE

TO GET THE PINK BOX AROUND THE PAGE HEADER I CREATED A CSS PIECE CALLED .DAGREENBOX AND GAVE IT WIDTH, BACKGROUND COLOR, PADDING, MARGIN AND TEXT + TEXT DECO

FOR THE BODY I USED A SIMPLE CARD WITH A PHOTO PUT INSIDE OF IT, INSTEAD OF FORMATTING THE TEXT, I JUST FLOAT-LEFT THE PHOTO SO THAT THE TEXT WRAPS AROUND IT WHEN PUT INTO THE BOX. I PUT SOME PADDING AND TEXT FONT AND FAMILY IN THE CSS FOR THIS PART


CHANGES I MADE TO CONTACT.HTML

FOR THE BODY I USED A DIVIDED CARD FORM PROVIDED TO ME FROM BOOTSTRAP. I HAD TO CHANGE A FEW OF THE WORDS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I WANTED FOR SIMILARITY TO THE EXAMPLE PHOTO. THE FORMS ON BOOTSTRAP HAD DIFFERENT OPTIONS, AND I HAD TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE MESSAGE BOX IN THE CSS. THIS MAKES MESSAGES LOOK BETTER SO THAT YOU DON'T ONLY HAVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT ON A LIMITED LINE AT A TIME


CHANGES I MADE TO PORTFOLIO.HTML
-----------------------------------------------

FOR THE BODY I USED A CONTAINER CARD WITH A GRID. I TOOK THE STYLE FROM BOOTSTRAP, BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE AS LARGE AS I WANTED, SO I COPIED A PORTION OF THE CODE AND PASTED IT AGAIN TO GIVE ME 6 IMAGE WINDOWS INSTEAD OF 4. I PLAYED AROUND WITH WHERE TO PUT THE <H3> AND <P> TAGS UNTIL I GOT IT TO A SPOT WHERE IT LOOKED NICE AND NEAT.


CHANGES I MADE TO CSS
--------------------------------

I DID NOT MAKE MANY CHANGES HERE, I ADDED A MEDIA QUERY WHICH ALLOWS MY PAGES TO SHRINK WHEN THE WINDOW IS DOWNSIZED, AND I PUT STYLING FOR: A BOX, THE BODY OF ALL THREE DOCS, THE WIDTH OF ALL CARDS, THE HEIGHT OF THE MESSAGE BOX IN THE CONTACT FORM, AND THE MARGINS OF ALL THE IMAGES ON ALL DOCS
